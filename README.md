# Hi.
## I'm Thomas Wilburn, and this is my profile.

I'm a data journalist with over a decade of experience in building rich, interactive storytelling. Currently, I'm the senior news apps developer for NPR Visuals. Before that, I created cutting-edge stories and tools on the Interactives team at The Seattle Times.

I've been a guest lecturer at The University of Washington, worked at ArenaNet (makers of Guild Wars 2) and Big Fish Games, ran the Multimedia Team at Congressional Quarterly, and produced educational audio and video for the World Bank Institute.

In my spare time, I'm a bassist, a b-boy, and a blogger. I like sandwiches, dogs, and lists with three items in them.
